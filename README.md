# Improved-B-RVFL-nets
This project presents an improved algorithm, named IB-RVFL, which is a complete Bayesian framework combined with the Random Vector Functional-Link (RVFL) networks for uncertain data modeling. In comparison to the existing work, we address the use of prior distributions on the parameters of basis functions. This additional information helps to enhance the learning power of the model and provides an effective solution for the difficult and significant setting problem of random parameters in existing RVFL-based modelling techniques. A Variational Inference (VI) method is used to obtain an approximation of the intractable posterior distribution, which helps to realize automatic inference of the hyper-parameters and gives a probability estimate for the test data. Simulation results on nine data sets show that the proposed method performs favourably.
